# Autographa Lite

This is a standalone desktop application which hopes to aid and be a friendly companion of the Bible Translator. In essence it is a basic [USFM](http://paratext.org/about/usfm) editor which is capable of import and export of USFM files. It has handy features like color-coded diffs across imported texts for comparison between revisions and search and replace. The application is currently under active development and we encourage you to contribute to the project!

## Developer Setup
It is relatively easy to setup the application locally for developement.


### Prerequisite
[Node JS 6.5.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.5.0/)

### Mac (tested on MacOS Sierra 10.12.3) and *nix Setup (tested on Ububtu 16.04) 
Fork this repository.   
```> cd bib-edit && npm install ```   
```> npm start```
<br>
This should start the application and open up the main screen.
