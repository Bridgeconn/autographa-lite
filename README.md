# Autographa Lite

This is a standalone desktop application which hopes to aid and be a friendly companion of the Bible Translator. In essence it is a basic [USFM](http://paratext.org/about/usfm) editor which is capable of import and export of USFM files. It has handy features like color-coded diffs across imported texts for comparison between revisions, search and replace and export to formatted HTML.

## Developer Setup
It is relatively easy to setup the application locally for developement.


### Prerequisite
[Node JS 8.2.1](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.2.1/)

### Mac (tested on MacOS Sierra 10.13.3) and *nix Setup (tested on Ububtu 17.10) 
Fork this repository.   
```% cd autographa-lite && npm install ``` 

```% npm start```
<br>
This should start the application and open up the main screen.
